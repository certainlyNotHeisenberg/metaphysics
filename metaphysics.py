# _Metaphysics_ is a pair of sculptures. One is a domino made of dice, and the other is a die made of dominoes. The latter is the focus of the code here, since constructing it properly requires a series of fairly complex calculations.
#####

#####
### Goals
#
# This code accomplishes two key goals:
# 1. List the sequence of dominoes that cover the die.
# 2. Determine the minimum number of domino sets required to make the die.
# Moreover, it does so in essentially a "scale free" way: the same goals can be accomplished for larger (or smaller) versions of the sculptures by simply changing a few parameters.

# The latter goal (determining `min_num_sets`) necessitates a long sequence of intermediate calcuations. To help you follow the code below, here's a brief summary of the major steps:
# 1. Number the squares from 0 to `num_squares` - 1.
# 2. Calculate `domino` and `number` for a square from the square number `square`.
# 3. Define the dots with coordinates.
# 4. Define the collections of dots for each side.
# 5. Calculate the white areas from the collections of dots.
# 6. Convert the dots and white areas from local into global coordinates.
# 7. Find the full and half dominoes that constitute the dots and white areas.
# 8. Count how many full and half dominoes constitute them.
# 9. Determine `min_num_sets` from these counts.
#####

#####
### Background
#
# The die of dominoes is a cube tiled by a circular domino train in a Hilbert curve pattern. (To be technically precise, it's a polygonal approximation to a Hilbert curve, since the Hilbert curve itself is the infinite limit of such approximations.) The standard Hilbert curve is open and fills the unit square, such that many copies of it fill the real number plane ($\mathbb{R}^2$). But since a cube is topologically closed, the Hilbert curve in this case will also be closed in that it will "loop back on itself". 
#
# There are many ways one could describe such a Hilbert curve, but it's useful to (arbitrarily) pick out "start" and "end" points for clarity.

#
# Also shown above is the orientation of dots on the die. Note that this is quite a particular orientation. Not only is the order of numbers specific, but so is the way the dots are laid out on each side. For example, the 2-dot side could have dots on the other diagonal instead, but it doesn't. All of this is based on physical dice I used as references. A fun fact I learned in the process of inspecting and researching them: dice are designed such that two opposite sides' dots always sum to 7!
#
# The full Hilbert curve is composed of (traditional, open) Hilbert curves on each side of the cube. Each of these corresponds to either a "type 1" or "type 2" tiling (hence the 1 and 2 indices in the side names). 
#
# For a type 1 tiling, the Hilbert curve starts in the upper left and ends in the upper right corner. For a type 2 tiling, the curve starts in the upper left and ends in the lower left corner.
# 
# start     end                 start

#                               end
#
# Note how this changes the local coordinate axes, as the diagram above indicates.
#
# These are both rotations of the "standard" Hilbert curve, which is the default for the `hilbertcurve` package I leverage below. That standard curve starts in the lower left and ends in the lower right corner:
#
#  ___________        
# |           |

# ^           ^        x
# start     end
#
# To keep track of things, it's helpful to label the sides and dots. I label the sides, intuitively enough, based on the number of dots they have. For consistency, I list them in the order the appear on the diagram shown above, following standard left to right and top to bottom ordering: Side 1, Side 2, Side 4, etc.
#
# I label each dot with one index corresponding to the side it's on and a second index corresponding to its ordering on the side, left to right and top to bottom from the perspective of the diagram above. And again, I list them in order: Dot 1A, Dot 2A, Dot 2B, Dot 4A, Dot 4B, Dot 4C, Dot 4D, etc. For clarity:
#
# Labeling of dots:
#  ___________ ___________
# |           |        2A |
# |     1A    |        +  |
# |     +     |  2B       |
# |           |  +        |

#             |  4A    4B |  6A 6B 6C |
#             |  +     +  |  +  +  +  |
#             |  4C    4D |           |

#                         |  5D +  5E |  3C +     |

#                         |___________|___________|
#
# It's also helpful to have coordinates for each side ("local" coordinates) and for the whole cube ("global" coordinates). Local coordinates always start at [0,0], but global coordinates start at different values for different sides so they're always unique. (See elsewhere below for more details.)
#
# Similarly, these local and global coordinates correspond to squares the local and global Hilbert curves pass through. Locally (on each side), the squares are indexed starting at 0. Globally, the squares are indexed starting at 0 on Side 1 and with higher indices across the cube.

### Preliminaries
#
# - 'square' indexes the squares the Hilbert curve runs through, starting at 0.
# - 'domino' indexes the dominoes tiling the cube, starting at 1. Note that here the tiling is defined to begin with a half domino. It could begin with a full one â€” both are valid tilings in line with the Hilbert curve, so it's a matter of choice. (I explain elsewhere why choosing the half domino approach was important for this project.)
# - 'term' indexes the term in my Wallis-like domino train product. Each such term includes two fractions multiplied together.
# - 'number' is the number of a particular half domino on a square.

### Hilbert Curve Parameters
#
# **Important:** Note that these are paramaters for the local Hilbert curves on one side of the cube, not the global Hilbert curve covering the whole cube.
#
# This uses the [`hilbertcurve`](https://pypi.org/project/hilbertcurve/) package.
#
# - `iterations` is the number of iterations of (the polygonal approximation to) the Hilbert curve. For _Metaphysics_, this will be 4 for the smallest scale version but greater for the larger scale versions.
# - `dimensions` is the number of spatial dimensions. For _Metaphysics_, this will always be 2, since each local Hilbert curve corresponds to a tiling of one side of a cube (which has 2 dimensions).
# - `num_squares` is the number of squares in a Hilbert curve with so many iterations and of so many dimensions. (Since for _Metaphysics_ I'm always using 2 dimensions, I use the more specific term "squares" rather than the fully general "hypercubes".) In general, a Hilbert curve fills a hypercube with $2^{i \cdot d}$ unit hypercubes contained within in it, where $i$ is `iterations` and $d$ is `dimensions`. For 4 iterations and 2 dimensions, that's a square with $2^8 = 256$ unit squares contained within it.
#
# For _Metaphysics_, I'm using 6 connecting Hilbert curves (in 2 different orientations) to cover the surface of a cube.

# Note that this package produces a Hilbert curve that begins at the lower left and ends at the lower right corner. As a result, no matter the orientation of the Hilbert curve considered here, I pick coordinates such that [0,0] is at the beginning and [`sqrt(num_squares)`,0] is at the end.
#####
iterations = 4
dimensions = 2
hilbert_curve = HilbertCurve(iterations, dimensions)
num_coordinates_per_side = 2 ** iterations
num_squares = num_coordinates_per_side ** dimensions


#####
### Dots
# 
# "Dots" are the dots (sometimes called "pips") on a die.
#
# For _Metaphysics_, I'm using two Hilbert curve orientations, which means there are two types of tiling. These have different coordinate orientations, as described above.
#
# The dots have two indices. The first (1, 2, 3, ...) indicates the side of the die the dot is on. The second (A, B, C, ...) indicates the order of the dot on its side of the die. They're ordered from left to right and top to bottom from the perspective of the diagram above. 
#
# These are currently defined only for a Hilbert curve tiling with 256 squares. Ideally, they'd be defined independently of the number of squares, with variables rather than numbers, but doing this is complicated because the shape of each dot and the spacing between dots and the cube sides should change with the number of squares. So, I'm skipping this for now.
#
# **Important:** The dots are first defined in "local" coordinates, where each side's coordinates goes from [0,0] to [`sqrt(num_squares)` - 1, `sqrt(num_squares)` - 1], i.e. [15,15]. (Confusingly enough, these are "global variables" in the programming sense!) The `get_global_coordinates()` function further below will later transform these local coordinates into global ones, where each side's coordinates start at a multiple of `sqrt(num_squares)` times the index of the side in the ordering shown in the diagram above (starting at 0). In global coordinates, the first side starts at [0,0], the second at [`sqrt(num_squares)`,`sqrt(num_squares)`] i.e. [16,16], the third at [`2 * sqrt(num_squares)`, `2 * sqrt(num_squares)`] i.e. [32,32], and so on.

# Note that a single coordinate is a list of numbers (with a number of elements equal to `dimensions`, which for _Metaphysics_ is always 2), e.g. [2,5]. Coordinates (plural) are lists of such lists, e.g. [[2,5], [6,3], [7,7]].

# Given a number of domino sets and full and half domino counts, return a list of dominoes to cut. Note that the number of dominoes in this list is the number of cuts to make.
#
# This list is optimal in the sense that this function first includes dominoes for which both halves can be used and the dominoes for which only one half can be used. There may be even more optimal sets, but I imagine determining this would involved fairly detailed combinatorics of the dominoes themselves and I haven't bothered to think about it much!
#
# Note that the number of sets must be greater than or equal to the maximum count in the full dominoes counts. Otherwise, the function will raise an error.
